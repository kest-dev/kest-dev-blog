      I had recently been job shadowing at an ISP, looking into how the tools
      are created and how they are used. They had begun a rewrite of their
      current system, due to the demand of new features and the source code
      becoming practically ancient. The updated system is utilizing modern and
      industry standard APIs and codebases. This website is a learning
      experiment in those modern standards. This website has been built from
      Vue.js (with Typescript) and Bootstrap. These libraries provide an easier
      time to swiftly create and build websites (Bootstrap allows me to stay
      sane by providing css presets that are very nice).
